C 10/12/26 MHP via Claude
C code changed to merge 35 single-purpose namelist COMMON blocks into one
C COMMON/NMLPAR/, declared identically in all 89 files that held any of
C them.  Merged, in this member order:
C   ALATM03, BURNSCS, BURTOL, CALS2, CCOUT2, CHRONE, CMIXING, CORE, CT2
C   CT3, DIFUS, FLAG, GOVS, GRAVS2, GRAVS3, GRAVS4, GRAVST, HEFLSH, INTATM
C   INTENV, MAG, MASSCHG, NEWCMP, NEWENG, NEWXYM, NOTRAN, OPALEOS, PO
C   ROT, SBROT, SPOTS, TRACK, VMULT2, VNEWCB, WEAK
C
C Every member is a namelist variable the physics routines read, so this
C is the single block the F90 module conversion will become.  Blocks that
C also hold derived or working members are left for a later pass, and
C COMMON/IOUNITS/, COMMON/INTPAR/ and COMMON/CONSTANTS/ stay out by
C agreement.  No member is CHARACTER.
C
C Each file declares the FULL block rather than a leading prefix: a
C DATA-initialized short declaration of a longer block silently
C corrupts memory, and the linker's 'size of symbol changed' warning is
C the only signal.  The declaration below is generated from one list, so
C all 89 copies are byte-identical.
